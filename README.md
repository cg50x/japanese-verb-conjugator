# Japanese Verb Conjugator
This is an experimental library of functions that can generate different conjugations for a given japanese word. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help me learn:
* japanese verb conjugations and grammar rules
* Typescript

I figured if I want to learn Typescript and Japanese at the same time, why not make a project that uses both?

*NOTE:* Development is currently unstable as this library is solely for the purpose of my Japanese learning. Also, I'm also trying to figure out a good way to design this so that I can use this other projects. Therefore, expect lots of breaking changes!

## TODOs

Here's a list of my tasks for this project. This list will grow as I keep reading more of the Genki textbooks.

* ~~Short Forms (Chapter 8, 9)~~
* Potential Verbs (Chapter 13)
* Hope or Aspiration (Chapter 11)
* Volitional Form (Chapter 15)
* ~~Adjective conjugations (Chapter 5)~~

## How to run
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm test`

## Future Plans
I plan to keep adding more conjugations to this library, as I finish more chapters of the Genki textbooks. In the future, I'd like this library to have *more* than just verb conjugation. Here's a wishlist of things I want to add:
* Random sentence generation (given a grammar rule and a word bank, generate a random sentence)
* Allow this library to be used in both Typescript and Javascript projects
